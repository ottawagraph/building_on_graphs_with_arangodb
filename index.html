## Features vs speed?*

*Standard vendor benchmark caveats apply

---

class: center, middle
# A better set of tradeoffs for the data we see

* flexibility (document model)
* Doesn't throw away features you need for the sake of speed:
  * ACID
  * joins (graph model)
  * transactions


## Think of it as MongoDB without the eventual regret.

## Compact by default

Assume that everything should be an attribute on a vertex.

### Should this be a vertex?
* Will it be accessed on it's own? (ie: showing comments without the post)
* Will it be edited on it's own?
* Does/could the attribute have relationships of it's own? (assuming you care)
* Would/should this attribute exist without it's parent vertex?

## Figuring things out

Creating some data in ArangoDB's admin interface helps you think things
through.

# Tradeoffs

---

class: center, middle

### Some things get easier

* Joiny Queries
* Complicated/variable relationships
* Adding attributes to existing data
* Dealing with new types of data

### Some things are harder

* Inserting data is complex
* Changing the stucture of the graph requires scripting (no tools yet)

# Graphs can be fine grained data

[
  {
    "type" : "office",

## Some vertices need context

Sometimes you end up pulling a subgraph. Displaying parts is easy.

What should an edit form look like?

---

This feels like a lot

Maybe ReST is for medium grain data?

}

## Server

ArangoDB gives you options.

Send a transaction to the server.

```javascript

var action = String(function (args) {
  var db = require('org/arangodb').db;
  // Everthing in here is synchronous

  // Insert all the things!
});

// Send that function to run as a transaction!
db.transaction({write: ['vertices', 'edges']}, action, [args])
```
---

class: center, middle
## Server

Create a custom endpoint on the server with Foxx

```javascript

//app.js
var Foxx = require("org/arangodb/foxx");
var app = new Foxx.Controller(applicationContext),
        arangodb = require("org/arangodb"), db = arangodb.db;

app.get("/all_the_things", function(req, res) {
  db._query('INSERT {foo: "bar"} INTO vertices')
  return res.json({"inserted": "all the things"});
});

// manifest.json
{
  "name": "insert_all_the_things",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "author": "Mike Williamson",
  "controllers": {
    "/": "app.js"
  },
  "defaultDocument": ""
}

```

---

class: center, middle
## Server


.align_left[```sh
mike@longshot:~/projects/foxx☺ foxx-manager --server.database=test install . /insert
Application insert_all_the_things version 0.0.1 installed successfully at mount point /insert

# What all this gets you

* Handling complex data without complexity
* Being able to say "yes" when people ask "Could we also put X in there?"
* An entire world of network analysis that is now accessible

There is lots to explore...
